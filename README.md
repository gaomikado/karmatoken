# KarmaToken

The Karma Protocol is a community driven, fair launched DeFi Token. Four functions occur during each trade: Reflection, LP Acquisition, Burn, and Charity Donations

## Features

Community driven & fair launch. 
Karma transfers rewards from a donation wallet to fund charities selected by the holders.
Every trade contributes towards automatically generating liquidity that goes into multiple pools used by exchanges.
Holders & Charities earn passive income rewards through static reflection as they watch their balance of BUSD grow indefinately.
